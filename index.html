            <p>An ‘Early Warning System’ identifying children in potential distress by tracking their school attendance is helping authorities in the capital to intervene and identify solutions to keep them in school.
    
                From the system’s introduction in September 2021 to February 2022, 1,600 children were brought back to school — at least for the immediate time being — after interventions through this tracking, according to records maintained by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR).

        </div>
        <div id="col5"><p>The ‘Early Warning System’— designed by the Directorate of Education’s IT department and the DCPCR — is linked to school attendance records. If a child is absent for a day, it sends out an automated message to the child’s guardian stating that the child was absent and “We hope all is well”. In case of no response, an operator will call them the next day to enquire.Different interventions come into operation depending on the nature of distress in which the child may be.Thisw system help the parents to let know about their child appearance.</p></div>
